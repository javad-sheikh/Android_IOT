Android controller with custom module

This repository contains my Bachelors's degree thesis project codes.
This project consisted of two parts:
1- A hardware to replace conventional switches
2- An android program to turn these switches on and off.

For the first part, we simulated the circuit on Proteus Design Suite before buying any parts. The program to run the ATMEGA8 was written using CodeVision and the HEX files were obtained from CodeVision. The files for CodeVision is located in "Microcontroller files" folder. The HEX file was uploaded into Proteus Design Suite and the simulation was successful. The files for Proteus Design Suite are located in "proteus" folder. The schematic of the circuit is Shown below:

After that, we designed a PCB using Altium designer. The Altium designer project files are in the Altium folder. I had to work hard to make this pcb as small as possible to fit it in conventional switch place.
